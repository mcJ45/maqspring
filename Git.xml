         >> Git is currently the most popular implementation of a distributed version control system.

         >> Git originates from the Linux kernel development and was founded in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. Nowadays it is used by many popular open source projects, 
		     e.g., the Android or the Eclipse developer teams, as well as many commercial organizations.

         >> The core of Git was originally written in the programming language C, but Git has also been re-implemented in other languages, e.g., Java, Ruby and Python
		 
		 >> GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

    1. Step 1. Create a Repository
	       
		   >> A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets,
		      and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project. 
		      GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.
		   
    2. Step 2. Create a Branch
     
          >>  Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
          >>  By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment
		      and make edits before committing them to master.
          >>  When you create a branch off the master branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. 
		      If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

	 

    3. Step 3. Make and commit changes
	
	      >> On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining 
		     why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

				Make and commit changes
				1. Click the README.md file.
				2. Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
				3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
				4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
				5. Click Commit changes button.

    4. Step 4. Open a Pull Request
	
	     >> Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone
  		    review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. 
		    The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.
         >> As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
         >> By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams,
 		    whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
         >> You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.
 
	5. Step 5. Merge your Pull Request
         
         >> In this final step, it’s time to bring your changes together – merging your readme-edits branch into the master branch.
				1.  Click the green Merge pull request button to merge the changes into master.
				2.  Click Confirm merge.
				3.  Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the Delete branch button in the purple box.
